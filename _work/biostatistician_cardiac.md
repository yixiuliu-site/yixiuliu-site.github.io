Yixiu works part-time as a Biostatistician at the Cardiac Science Manitoba at the St. Boniface Hospital, Winnipeg, MB. She provides statistical consulting and conducts data analysis for a research team with primary members of [Dr. Shuangbo Liu](https://cardiacsciencesmb.ca/staff/shuangbo-liu/), [Dr. John Ducas](https://cardiacsciencesmb.ca/staff/john-ducas/), [Dr. Lorraine Avery](https://cardiacsciencesmb.ca/staff/lorraine-avery/), and [Dr. Ashish Shah](https://cardiacsciencesmb.ca/staff/ashish-shah/). 

Dr. Liu is the Research Director, and Dr. Ducas, and Dr. Avery are the two co-leads for the [Manitoba acute coronary syndrame (ACS) Network](https://cardiacsciencesmb.ca/patients-visitors/clinical-areas-pathways/acs-network/). My projects for the Manitoba ACS Network team primarily focus on evaluating health care practices for the ACS patients throughout health regions in Manitoba using administrative data.

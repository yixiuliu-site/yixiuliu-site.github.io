Yixiu Liu isserved on the advisor committee for the 2023 Canadian Youth Delegate. The mandate was to advise and work closely with the delegate to engage youth in roundtable discussion(s) and the formulation of recommendations for Canada's position on global health policies/priorities related to pandemic preparedness/response. My primary focus was in the data science field.
